# SomaGCaMP Processing scripts

This is very much a work in progress: it is a collection of the scripts we are using to write the SomaGCaMP paper.

# Overview: 
In terms of scripts, the user can start with postProcessCNMF.m: That will call processCNMF.m, which is what actually runs the CNMF package with the parameters we used for the paper. Note: it requires that the user has the latest Caiman package installed, which is accessible here: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn-MATLAB
